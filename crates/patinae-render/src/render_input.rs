//! Pull-based input to `RenderState::sync` — the single bridge between the
//! host (`patinae`, CLI, web, tests) and the renderer.
//!
//! `patinae-render` deliberately knows nothing about `patinae-scene::Viewer`.
//!
//! Color resolution lives on the **host** side: per-atom base colours and
//! representation-specific colour overrides are pre-computed (once per
//! rebuild) and passed in via [`atom_colors`] / [`atom_rep_colors`]. The
//! renderer fuses them into one GPU colour LUT and applies per-rep alpha
//! (sphere_transparency, etc.) on top. This keeps the renderer free of any
//! palette / color-resolution code, and preserves the dependency graph:
//! scene/color policy stays upstream of the renderer.
