//! Renderer-owned GPU artifact descriptions.
//!
//! These types describe buffers that already exist inside `RenderState`.
//! They intentionally do not contain ray-tracing concepts; plugin hosts can
//! turn borrowed buffer refs into opaque ABI handles for any trusted GPU
//! plugin that wants to run compute work next to the renderer.
//!
//! A snapshot is a command-scoped view of renderer state after `RenderState`
//! has synchronized its scene store and representation buffers. The snapshot
//! borrows renderer buffers; callers must not retain it across mutable renderer
//! work, device recreation, or plugin command boundaries.
//!
//! # Layout Version
//!
//! `RENDER_ARTIFACT_LAYOUT_VERSION` changes when a plugin-visible role,
//! stride, topology meaning, representation slot, or count-source rule changes.
//! Plugin code should reject unknown versions instead of guessing layouts.
//!
//! # Shared Buffer Layouts
//!
//! `StdVertices` uses the 24-byte `StdVertex` layout shared by cartoon,
//! ribbon, surface, and mesh-wireframe output: `position` is three `f32` lanes
//! at byte offsets 0, 4, and 8; `normal_oct` is a packed octahedral normal at
//! byte offset 12; `group_id` is at byte offset 16; `flags` is at byte offset
//! 20. Consumers use `atom_offset + group_id` to address per-atom scene data.
//!
//! `SceneColorLut` uses `ColorLutEntry` with stride 64. The first 16 bytes are
//! base RGBA as four `f32` lanes. The next 48 bytes are twelve `u32` slots:
//! sphere, stick, line, dot, cartoon, ribbon, surface, mesh, ellipsoid, and
//! three padding slots. A slot value of `REP_COLOR_INHERIT` means the consumer
//! should use the base RGBA.
//!
//! # Representation Slots
//!
//! Representation color slots are stable in this order: sphere 0, stick 1,
//! line 2, dot 3, cartoon 4, ribbon 5, surface 6, mesh 7, ellipsoid 8.
//! `Other` is never assigned a color-LUT slot by this contract.
//!
//! # Count Sources
//!
//! `element_count` is a direct count only when no count or indirect buffer is
//! attached to a representation. `InstanceCount` buffers store one `u32` count.
//! `IndirectDraw` buffers store one WebGPU draw-indirect record of four `u32`
//! lanes. `max_element_count` remains the allocation capacity for validation
//! and bounds checks even when a GPU-side count source is authoritative.
